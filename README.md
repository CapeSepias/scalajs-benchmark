scalajs-benchmark
=================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/japgolly/scalajs-react.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/japgolly/scalajs-benchmark)

Benchmarks: written in Scala, run in your browser.

*Note: This is not affiliated with the official [Scala.JS](http://www.scala-js.org/) project; I just named this to be informative rather than interesting.*


## How does it work?

1. You depend on this library.
1. You write benchmarks.
1. You extend a `Main` app and link your benchmarks.
1. Compile; run in browser. No server required.
